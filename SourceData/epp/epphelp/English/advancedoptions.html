<h1><strong>Advanced  Options: Eliminating unrealistic curves</strong></h1>
<p>Each of the models available on the  Project page has a number of model-specific limits and settings that can be  adjusted to influence the resulting fits. In addition, all three models allow you  to set conditions on prevalence, i.e., the prevalence is above or below a  certain level in a given year. This page discusses the options available for  each model and what they do. Before reading it, we strongly recommend you first  read carefully the section entitled &ldquo;Behind the scenes: what really happens  when you click Fit?&rdquo; on the Project page help, which informs this discussion.</p>
<h2><strong>Advanced Options takes different forms for different models</strong></h2>
<p>Because the limits and settings vary  by model, you will see three different displays depending on which model you  have selected when you click the Advanced Options button in the lower left of  the Project page. The following are the three possibilities:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_clip_image002a_en.png" alt="" width="637" height="332" /></p>
<p>Each of these displays has one or  more model specific limits and settings areas, highlighted by the red boxes  above. In addition, each of them has a section labeled &ldquo;Conditions on  prevalence&rdquo;, which applies user defined prevalence criteria to the curves being  selected. </p>
<h2><strong>Prevalence conditions and how to use them</strong></h2>
<p>There are situations in which  certain curves are mathematically acceptable, i.e., they fit the data  reasonably well, but they are unrealistic given our knowledge of HIV epidemics.  Prevalence conditions allow you to remove these curves from the final set  generated by EPP. Any curve which does not match all the prevalence conditions  provided will be eliminated from the sample by setting its likelihood to zero.  You should apply this cautiously and only if you have a clear understanding of  the current state of your epidemic and data to support your choice. If you apply  conditions that remove curves that are actually possible in your country, you  may misinterpret the state of your epidemic and provide incorrect information  for programmatic purposes.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Eliminating unrealistic early  epidemics with upper prevalence limits</em></strong></h3>
<p>Take for example the data set in the  figure below. Because the surveillance data started well into the epidemic and  is relatively flat, there is a set of earlier curves, circled by the red oval,  that represent early and very rapidly rising epidemics. They do &ldquo;fit&rdquo; the data  with enough accuracy that they are kept by EPP. However, given our knowledge of  the epidemic in the country, these are not possible – they would have produced  a substantial early AIDS caseload by the mid-1980s, which was not observed. In  addition, they are clearly affecting our uncertainty bounds. Notice how the  uncertainty bounds between 1980 and 1990 are close to 3%. The more realistic  scenario is that shown by the best fit curve and the bounds from 1995 forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_clip_image004.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="219" /></p>
<p>Prevalence conditions are intended  to deal with exactly these types of problems. By setting a constraint, for  example, prevalence in 1988 must be below 1%, we can eliminate most of these earlier  unrealistic curves. This is done under the heading &ldquo;Conditions on prevalence&rdquo;  on the Advanced Options page. When you first open Advanced Options, the  prevalence conditions will appear as:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_clip_image006_en.png" alt="" width="414" height="144" /></p>
<p>There are five upper limits on  prevalence and five lower limits on prevalence. By default, the upper limits  are set at 100%, and the lower limits are set at 0%. This means that you  initially start with no conditions on prevalence, since all curves are between  0% and 100%. If we apply a condition by modifying the condition on the first  line to select only curves with prevalence less than or equal to 1% in 1988,  any curves with prevalence above this level will be removed during the fitting  process. That is, they will be given zero likelihood so they will never be  selected when we pick out our final curves.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_clip_image008_en.png" alt="" width="417" height="144" /></p>
<p>This removes the unrealistic earlier  epidemic curves and produces the much cleaner picture shown below – much more  in line with our knowledge of the local epidemic,</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_clip_image010.jpg" alt="" width="208" height="207" /></p>
<h3><strong><em>Bringing epidemics up earlier with  lower prevalence limits</em></strong></h3>
<p>Another situation that sometimes  arises is that we primarily have data on the decline of an epidemic, but only  limited information about its early history. Consider for example the fit shown  below for a sub-population of people who inject drugs. Virtually all of the  surveillance data is available post-peak. If you fit this data with EPP with no  prevalence conditions, you would get the figure shown in red, which is an  epidemic peaking in 2002 at about 35%. However, there is data from ad hoc  studies in country that indicates that prevalence among injecting drug users  was almost 50% in 1995. However, because this is not part of the surveillance  system, it is not included in the data set shown here.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_clip_image012.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="210" /></p>
<p>How might we apply this earlier  information to improve the fit? Prevalence conditions offer one possibility. In  this case use a low prevalence condition. Apply a condition that the prevalence  in 1995 must be above 40% and then refit.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_clip_image014_en.png" alt="" width="417" height="145" /></p>
<p>Now you will get an epidemic that  goes high earlier, but which still fits the data available. In sparse data  conditions, when the amount of surveillance data is limited, prevalence  conditions based on several high quality ad hoc studies may be very helpful in  selecting an epidemic that is consistent with the different sources of  information available.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_clip_image016.png" alt="" width="222" height="216" /></p>
<h3><strong><em>Limiting downstream epidemics</em></strong></h3>
<p>A final situation that often arises  in concentrated epidemics is having an extremely sparse set of data for an  important sub-population, for example, men who have sex with men. In many  countries data has only been recently collected on this sub-population, showing  epidemics rapidly on the rise. However, often we only have two or three data  points in our trend, technically not enough to get a good mathematical fit with  EPP. Given the rapid rise in the MSM component of the epidemic we do not want  to leave them out of the national projection.</p>
<p>However, when we set our limited  data set, we find that it does not constrain the epidemic very much, allowing  anything from 2% to 65% prevalence in 2015 as shown below. This should not be  that surprising; there is considerable uncertainty associated with such a small  collection of data points. However, does this mean that your epidemic among MSM  may rise to 65%? Probably not. That has not been observed in any setting so  far. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_clip_image018.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="220" /></p>
<p>So what do you do? First, look  around for data among MSM from nearby countries or regionally. What do their  prevalence trends look like? What are the levels at which prevalence among MSM  stabilizes? Let's suppose that we find that in most nearby countries HIV  prevalence among MSM seems to be stabilizing below 10%. We could apply this as  an upper prevalence limit on MSM prevalence in 2015. In addition, the graph  shown above has some early curves that rise to 5% several years before 2000  that we know are not realistic since few MSM were found among AIDS patients in  the early years of the epidemic. So let's apply two prevalence conditions:  prevalence in 1998 must be less than 1% and prevalence in 2015 has to be less  than 10%, i.e., below the stabilization level seen in surrounding countries.  Save the changes and refit your epidemic. This produces an epidemic that  stabilizes below 10%. Keep in mind that when you start to constrain epidemics  which have a natural wide uncertainty, you are imposing your beliefs on what is  reasonable in your country and your uncertainty estimates may be too narrow.  This requires that you be open and transparent about the assumptions being  made, so that others can review your conclusions and judge the validity of the  results with full information about the decisions made in fitting.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_clip_image020.jpg" alt="" width="234" height="228" /></p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: to understand the next three sections, the user must first  read the section on how fits are done behind the scenes on the Project page. If  you do not understand that section, this discussion will make little sense.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Advanced Options for the EPP Classic  model</em></strong></h3>
<p>Now let's turn to discussion of the  options related to each model. Recall that EPP works by randomly generating a  set of curves based on the model chosen. The Advanced Options for each model  determine what that set of curves looks like. For EPP Classic each curve is  based upon a randomly chosen combination of (<em>r</em>, <em>f0</em>, <em>t0</em> and <em>Φ</em>). The limits on curve generation, highlighted in the red box  below, determine the possible range of each of these parameters. For example,  the <em>r</em> limits by default are that 0.5  &lt; r &lt; 150.0, that is the <em>r</em> for  random curves is chosen as a value between 0.5 and 150. Similarly for <em>f0</em> and <em>t0.</em>.The <em>Φ</em> parameter is slightly different in  that it is chosen from a bell-shaped curve around the median value specified as  &ldquo;phi median&rdquo; with a spread given by &ldquo;scale&rdquo;. A higher value of spread means the  possible values are more widely distributed around the median.<br />
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_clip_image022_en.png" alt="" width="442" height="474" /></p>
<p>In most cases, the average user will  only change the values for t0, because he or she might have better local  information about the possible range of start years for their national  epidemic. By default the start years are chosen between 1970 and 1990. However,  in some countries with concentrated epidemics later start years, e.g., 1985 to  2005 may be more appropriate. If you do change this be sure to cover the full  range of possible start years in your country. There is no harm in estimating a  wider range, as EPP will still pick the start year for the best fit curve based  on fitting the data. However, if you estimate to narrow a range, you may force  the epidemic to grow too rapidly or too slowly and it may not truly reflect  your national situation. The entry labeled Iota is beyond the scope of this  help and should only be changed on consultation with UNAIDS in extremely low  prevalence settings.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Advanced Options for the Variable-r  model</em></strong></h3>
<p>The Advanced Options for the  Variable-r model are shown in the red box below. The value <em>r0</em> refers to the initial value of <em>r</em> in the start year (<em>t0</em> below) and the <em>y0</em> refers  to the initial pulse of HIV infection that starts the epidemic. The random walk  variance <em>v</em>, <em>lambda</em> and <em>lambda_A</em> determine the size of the allowed changes in <em>r</em> in each year. In practice, <em>lambda </em>helps to determine the smoothness of the incidence curve. A higher value of <em>lambda</em>, e.g., 0.09, will result in  less smooth incidence curves, but an easier time finding a fit. Too low a value  of lambda, e.g., 0.001, will result in curves that are very smooth, but which  probably don't go through your data. There is a trade-off between how smooth  the incidence curve is and the quality of the fit to the data. In general, we  recommend you remain with the defaults. If you choose values that are far  removed from these defaults, you will not be able to find any curves that fit  your data. The final entry &ldquo;aa2&rdquo; is yet another smoothing constraint, which  removes curves that change to rapidly. However, you should not try to change it  without guidance from UNAIDS. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_clip_image024_en.png" alt="" width="558" height="516" /></p>
<h3><strong><em>Advanced Options for the Workbook  model</em></strong></h3>
<p>There are two sections to the  Advanced Options for the Workbook model. The first section at the top of the display  is identical to that for the EPP Classic model described earlier. This is  because the Workbook model is built upon EPP Classic.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedoptions_image026_en.png" alt="" width="442" height="671" /></p>
<p>The lower display has two entries:  data quality and number of sites. The Workbook model is intended to fit a  single data trend, obtained from a series of UNAIDS Workbooks for different  years. It is hard to estimate uncertainty for this single series. So the  Workbook model generates a series of sites by generating a set of trends equal  to the number of sites specified. Each trend is generated by randomly varying  each of your annual data points by the positive and negative percentage range  specified under Data quality. That is, if one of your annual numbers is 2% and  you have chosen &ldquo;good&rdquo; data quality, a randomly chosen number between 1.2%  (down 40%) and 3.2% (up 60%) will be used for that year in the generated  trends. The model then fits these artificially generated sites to estimate the  overall uncertainty in your Workbook fit. These data quality values have been  derived by the UNAIDS Reference Group from a careful review of a large number  of UNAIDS Workbooks and assessments of the quality of the data going into them.  If you increase the number of sites, you fits will take longer as the  likelihood calculations increase in complexity.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Generating a second opinion – the  seed</em></strong></h3>
<p>Before closing, we should introduce  you to one final feature: the current seed entry. Each of the Advanced Options  displays contains a field labeled &ldquo;Current seed&rdquo;. By default, next to it is the  number 1. Recall that the fitting approaches in EPP involve random generation  of sets of parameters within certain ranges. This makes use of a random number  generator. In order to ensure that you get the same results each time you run  EPP, this random number generator is set to produce the same string of numbers  each time it is run and this string is determined by the seed value. You can  change the string of random numbers by changing the seed. This will result in a  new best fit and range of uncertainties, which will be similar to, but not  exactly the same as when the seed is 1. If you have a lot of data, you should  see little difference with different seeds. However, if your data is sparse,  the results may vary substantially. In practice, we generally do not recommend  that people change the seed as it may make it more difficult for you to compare  your results with others using EPP on the same data.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Be cautious in using the Advanced  Options and document your work</em></strong></h3>
<p>Whenever you use Advanced Options  you must exercise extreme caution. Recall that in using these options you are  imposing your beliefs on the epidemic fit. If you apply a prevalence condition,  you are eliminating some curves that actually do fit your data. That means your  prevalence conditions must be evidence-informed and not just made in an ad hoc  fashion to manipulate the final shape of the epidemic. When you apply a  prevalence condition, be sure to use the Source button on the Project page to  document what data you used to inform that prevalence condition. Prevalence  condition should not be applied arbitrarily, but only if you have solid  information that documents their validity. Similarly, if you change the  parameters for one of the models in Advanced Options, again document your  reasoning and the evidence that informs your decision. For example, if you  change <em>f0</em> in EPP Classic,  the fraction of the sub-population entering the group at risk of HIV, to be  between 0.0 and 0.2 provide the data that justifies why less than 20% of the  current sub-population is at risk of HIV. If you cannot justify a change in any  of these limits and conditions with data from a reliable source, then you  shouldn't make the change.</p>
