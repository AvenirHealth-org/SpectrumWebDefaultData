<h1><strong>Calibration  page: Adjusting to produce representative trends</strong></h1>
<p>After completing your last  sub-population fit on the Project page and clicking Save and continue, you are  automatically transferred to the Calibration page. Here you apply whatever  additional adjustments are needed to make each sub-population&rsquo;s HIV prevalence  and incidence trend more representative of the true trends in that group.</p>
<h2><strong>Why calibrate?  Surveillance data is far from perfect</strong></h2>
<p>As discussed on the Survey page and Project page help, in both  generalized and concentrated epidemics there is often an upward bias in  surveillance data relative to what is found in the population as a whole. For  generalized epidemics, the Project page has already applied either an automatic  downward adjustment if there were no surveys or has used the surveys to  calibrate your trends. If you entered surveys for a sub-population in a concentrated  epidemic, e.g., from an IBBS study, they too were applied on the Project page  to automatically calibrate the data for that sub-population.</p>
<p>However, even in concentrated epidemics where  surveys may not be available, there are often issues with the surveillance data  that may require further adjustments. Biases come from a number of sources.  Often surveillance, especially in key sub-population at higher risk, is only  carried out in major urban centers. Little data is available in smaller towns  and cities or rural areas. Many times the surveillance sites are  disproportionately in higher prevalence parts of the country. Most of these  factors tend to introduce an upward bias into the surveillance data.</p>
<p>The type of setting in which data are  collected can also influence the results. Often data for people who inject  drugs are collected in prisons, detention centers, or clinic settings. Many  studies have shown a higher risk of HIV among people who inject drugs with a  history of incarceration. Thus, data from clinics and detention centers are  probably biasing the results upward compared to what a community based survey  might detect. In drug treatment clinics, the bias may go either way - and you  will need to use local data to resolve whether you need to increase or decrease  your surveillance values to reflect the situation in the larger community of people  who inject drugs. </p>
<p>Similar considerations apply to prevalence  data for MSM and female sex workers. MSM data are most often collected in  cruising sites or in bars. And while there is substantial diversity in risk  among sex workers in different settings, surveillance data are often collected  in those settings that are most easily accessible or in STI clinics. Depending  on whether accessible sex workers have higher or lower risk, the surveillance  may be biased in either direction as an estimator of the prevalence for the  population of sex workers as a whole.</p>
<p>More often than not, our surveillance systems  in both generalized and concentrated epidemics tend to overestimate prevalence.  Sometimes smaller ad hoc studies allow the level of this bias to be assessed  and allow for calculation of how much we must calibrate our data up or down to  be more representative of the actual prevalence trend in these populations. Before  finalizing your projection, you should carefully consider whether you need to  adjust the final HIV prevalence trend for any of your sub-populations. If so,  before starting calculate the amount of adjustment.</p>
<h2><strong>The  Calibration page offers flexibility in adjusting for biases</strong></h2>
<p>The EPP calibration page, shown below, has  been designed to give you substantial flexibility in how you adjust your  prevalence trends. The page itself is relatively simple. At the top of the page  you have a set of radio buttons that allow you to select different calibration  methods. Below that is a large graph which allows you to see the effect of each  of the calibrations you can choose. On the right is the ever-present National  Epidemic Structure panel, required because calibrations are applied on a  sub-population specific basis. Note that the graph shows you both the best fit  curve and the survey data for easy comparison.</p>

<p>The seven options available to you  are shown here:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../English/images/calibration_clip_image004.png" alt="" width="583" height="182" /></p>
<h3><strong><em>Option1 Use the modeling results as  they are</em></strong></h3>
<p>This first option will keep whatever  calibration was done on the Project page. To summarize briefly, if you had a  generalized epidemic without surveys, it was downward adjusted by about 20%. If  you used surveys in your fitting in either a generalized or concentrated  epidemic, they were used to adjust the resulting projection. This is the  default option; if you are happy with the outcomes from the fitting, leave this  option checked. For more information about the calibrations done on the Project  page, see the help for that page <u>here</u>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>Option 2 Adjust the results taking  into account all surveys</em></strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes the statistical  methodologies used on the Project page will not have the best fit curve go  through your survey points exactly the way you like. In that case choose this  option. This will take the best fit curve, calculate its offset from the survey  data in each survey year, and then choose the adjustment that on average comes  closest to the combined survey points.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Option 3 Adjust the result for this  projection to agree with most recent survey</em></strong></h3>
<p>Many users prefer to have the  projection go through the last survey point, assuming that the most recent  survey is their best estimate of current prevalence. If this is what you would  like, select this option.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Option 4 Adjust the results to  global defaults for urban/rural bias</em></strong></h3>
<p>This option is identical to what is  done on the Project page in the case of a generalized epidemic without surveys.  It downward adjusts the projection by approximately 20%.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Option 5 Adjust to a specific  prevalence level in a specified year</em></strong></h3>
<p>Suppose your surveillance for sex  workers only includes brothel-based sex workers, but you know that they are  much higher risk than other types of sex workers and you have a number of ad  hoc surveys in different types of sex workers. By weighting the ad hoc survey  prevalence measurements by the size of the different sex worker groups, you  could estimate prevalence for a specific year that is more representative of  all sex workers. This calibration option allows you to enter that prevalence  level and year, and will adjust your projection to match.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Option 6 Adjust by a scale factor</em></strong></h3>
<p>Suppose you find that overall  prevalence in your surveillance system is twice as high as the true national  prevalence in a given sub-population. This might be the case, for example, if  your surveillance data for MSM was only from the capital city and other smaller  cities reported much lower prevalence. You could use this calibration option to  apply a scale factor of 0.5 to make that prevalence for MSM more nationally  representative. To use this option, just enter the scale factor to be used and  it will be immediately reflected in the graph below.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Option 7 Remove all calibrations</em></strong></h3>
<p>The final option is to remove all  calibrations. Even if calibrations had been done on the Project page, this will  remove them. </p>
<h2><strong>When satisfied with the calibration for sub-population,  click Save and continue</strong></h2>
<p>After you have selected a  calibration method, review the outcome in the graph to make sure it makes the  adjustment you desired. If you're comfortable with it him then click Save and  continue to move to the next sub-population. Please note that a calibration  must be applied to each sub-population. After setting the calibration for the  final sub-population, click Save and continue again to move on to the Fitting  Results page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Documenting your choices is critical</strong></h2>
<p>Should you make any calibration  choices besides &ldquo;use the modeling results as they are&rdquo;, you should use the  Source button in the lower right-hand corner to document your calibration  methodology. If you have weighted by different groups in a given sub-population  give the sources of the prevalence data and the size estimates. If you relied  on an estimate from a published paper, list that source. If you adjusted  prevalence to the findings of an ad hoc survey, give the survey results and  source. The calibrations made on this page are critical to ensuring a  representative national projection, so others will benefit from your  documenting them clearly.</p>
