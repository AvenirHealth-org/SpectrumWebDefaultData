<h1><strong>Project  page: Fitting your epidemic</strong></h1>
<p>EPP's primary purpose is to fit a  model to your surveillance data. Accordingly, the most important page in EPP is  the Project page. Here you select your model, apply any necessary constraints  to it, and carry out the actual fitting.</p>
<h2><strong>The Project page simplifies fitting</strong></h2>
<p>One of the goals in EPP 2011 was to  simplify the fitting process, making it easier for countries to generate their  national models. The interface for the Project page has been designed with this  in mind with &ldquo;One button fitting&rdquo;. If you are happy with the defaults, you only  need to click the big green Fit button in the upper right and EPP will fit your  first sub-population. The figure below highlights a number of key sections of  the page where you make changes to those defaults that affect your projection.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image002_en.jpg" alt="" width="616" height="408" /></p>
<h2><strong>An overview of what&rsquo;s on the Project page: 5 steps to  fitting your data</strong></h2>
<p>The figure above shows what the  Project page looks like the first time you select the Curve fitting (EPP) item from  the Spectrum Incidence menu. The first thing that jumps out at you is the large  graph in the center of the page. The green lines in this graph are your  surveillance data, taken from the HIV Data page. The data for each individual site  in different years is connected by a green line, so that you can see any  overall patterns in your data. The red diamonds on the graph are your survey  data, taken from the Surveys page. Before fitting, your data will appear  exactly as entered on the HIV Data and Surveys pages.</p>
<p>On the left-hand side of the page,  are the controls. At the very top in the red box is the model choice panel,  which also contains the fitting buttons. Below that, in the blue box under  &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; you will select how many curves to generate. In the next green box  with heading &ldquo;Show:&rdquo;, you choose what will be displayed on the graph. Finally,  on the lower left, circled in red, is the Advanced Options button where you can  make more sophisticated choices about the parameters in the models and also  apply prevalence conditions before fitting. Advanced Options is described in  more detail on its own help page <u><a href="advancedoptions.html">here</a></u>.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side is the  National Epidemic Structure panel, which you are already familiar with from  previous pages. It contains the list of all the sub-populations that make up  your national epidemic. You can move between sub-populations by clicking on an  entry in this panel. When you click on a new sub-population, the data and fit  (if already done) for that sub-population are loaded into the graph.</p>
<p>In the lower right, are the standard  EPP buttons for saving results and moving to the next sub-population or next  page (Save and continue button), bringing up the EPP help system (Help button),  entering comments and source information (Source button) and leaving without  saving changes (Cancel button). Now let's describe each step you take to do a  fit using the unique components on the Project page.</p>
<h3><strong><em>1. Choose your model according to  how much data you have</em></strong></h3>
<p>As described in the <u>Overview</u>, EPP allows you to use one of three  different models for fitting your surveillance and survey data. The default  model is Variable-r, but you can also choose EPP Classic and the Workbook model.  If you have a substantial amount of data for each sub-population, e.g., many  sites with long data trends, and you suspect that your incidence may have been  varying over time, you should choose the Variable-r model. If you have a more  limited set of data, e.g., only a few sites and a few points for each site, you  probably want to use EPP Classic. You may also choose to use EPP Classic if  there is no indication in your data of repeated rises and falls in prevalence  and incidence over time; it will fit faster and you will get a smoother  incidence curve. Normally if you are fitting actual surveillance data you will  use one of these two models. If however, you are in a very sparse data  situation and have estimated your annual national prevalence points from the  UNAIDS Workbook, then you should use the Workbook model. </p>
<p>It is possible to use a mix of Variable-r  and EPP Classic fits for your different sub-populations; the model selection  for each sub-population is independent. When EPP goes to prepare final results for  the national projection on the Fitting Results page, it will combine the curves  from the different models to generate the national best fit curve. It will also  generate combinations of those curves to estimate the national uncertainty, so  the underlying model does not matter. This means that there is no problem if  you fit one sub-population with Variable-r and another with EPP Classic.  Normally, you would not combine the Workbook model with the other models since  it is intended to prepare a single national projection curve based on a limited  number of points taken from UNAIDS Workbooks. </p>
<p>Selecting your model is easy, just  select the sub-population you&rsquo;re modeling in the National Epidemic Structure  panel and then click on the radio button next to the name of the model you wish  to use. This figure illustrates choosing the Variable-r model.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image004_en.png" alt="" width="268" height="116" /></p>
<h3><strong><em>2. Decide on training or national  projections</em></strong></h3>
<p>As we will describe shortly, in our  discussion of what happens behind the scenes after you click the &ldquo;Fit&rdquo; button,  EPP continues to compute until it has found a certain number of curves that are  close to your data. The spread of these curves estimates the uncertainty in  your projection. The statisticians recommend that you should generate approximately  1900 curves to have a good estimate of uncertainty. In practice, however, we  find the generating this larger number of curves can take a very long time,  overnight in some countries with very large surveillance data sets. Therefore,  in the initial development phases of your national model, we recommend you  generate only 400 curves. This will complete much more quickly, typically 15 to  30 min for the Variable-r model, a bit faster for EPP Classic and the Workbook  model, but still gives you a good idea of what the final national projection  will look like. Because the curve generation is a random process, the time it  takes may vary from country to country and sub-population to sub-population. In  general, if you have more sites in a given sub-population it will usually take  more time.</p>
<p>After you have completed a set of  fits at the &ldquo;Training&rdquo; level and are comfortable with how to use the features  of the Project page, you should then select &ldquo;National projection [1900 curves]&rdquo;  under &ldquo;Purpose of run&rdquo; for each sub-population and run another fit. This will  generate a more statistically correct set of curves for use as your final national  projection. Be prepared for this to take some time (occasionally hours on large  data sets with Variable-r; EPP Classic is somewhat faster, but may still take an  hour or two on a large data set), so you may want to keep busy with something  else while it runs.</p>
<p>To choose the number of curves  generated, select either &ldquo;Training [400 unique curves]&rdquo; or &ldquo;National projection  [1900 curves]&rdquo; under &ldquo;Purpose of run&rdquo;. In the figure below, EPP has been set to  generate 400 unique curves. Normally, you do not need to change the number of  curves resampled. Leave this value at 3000.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image006_en.png" alt="" width="266" height="145" /></p>
<h3><strong><em>3. Select the results to display</em></strong></h3>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image008.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="217" /> <br />
  </p>
<p align="left">The third decision you must make is  what data do you want to display on the graph? Above is an example of a graph  after the fit has been done with all graph options except &ldquo;Mean&rdquo; selected.</p>
<p>The options available to you on the  graph are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Best  fit</em></strong>. This option displays a red curve  on the graph which EPP has chosen as the best mathematical fit to your  surveillance and survey data from the 400 or 1900 curves it has found.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Bounds</em></strong>. Displayed as a pair of dashed blue lines in the graph,  this represents an estimate of the uncertainty in your projection. Of the  curves selected by EPP, 95% fall between these two lines.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Curves</em></strong>. This option displays, in light gray, all of the curves  that EPP selected as possible fits to your data. Because of the high number of  curves, this often appears in the graph as an almost solid gray area.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Mean</em></strong>. Choosing this displays the mean (arithmetic average) for  each year of the curves selected by EPP. This appears in the graph as a set of  small black boxes. Note: there is no mean shown in the above graph because the  mean and the median overlap in most years in this fit.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Median</em></strong>. Selecting this option displays the arithmetic median in  each year of the curves selected by EPP. This appears in the graph as a set of  small black crosses, which often overlap the best fit curve as in the figure  above.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Surv  data</em></strong>. This option displays both your  surveillance data and your survey data if you have used surveys in your  fitting. Note: in the above figure, the fit was done without surveys, so no  surveys are shown. As in the first Project page figure on this help page,  surveillance sites will be displayed as green lines and survey values will show  up as red diamonds.</li>
</ul>
<p>You select which of these you wish  to display by checking the box next to the desired option in the Fitting  Results section of the Project page:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image010_en.png" alt="" width="257" height="134" /></p>
<h3><strong><em>4. Set any Advanced Options</em></strong></h3>
<p>The final step before running a fit  is to set any advanced options for the model you are using. Advanced options  are accessed by clicking on the button labeled &ldquo;Advanced Options&rdquo; in the lower  left-hand side of the Project page. </p>
<p>In general, the advanced options  fall into two categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Model  specific limits</em></strong>.  These are normally constraints or initial values for the different parameters  used in the models. These are described in more detail on the <u><a href="advancedoptions.html">Advanced  Options</a></u> help page. Generally, they should only be changed by  advanced users who are familiar with the details of the models involved and  understand the consequences of changing them.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Prevalence  conditions</em></strong>. These are a  set of upper and lower limits on prevalence in specific years. They are  normally used to eliminate sets of curves that may be mathematically allowable  fits to your data, but which are not consistent with your understanding of how  the epidemic has evolved. Again, these will be discussed in more detail on the <u><a href="advancedoptions.html">Advanced  Options</a></u> page</li>
</ul>
<p>For completeness, we show the  Advanced Options page for the Variable-r model below that pops up when you  click on &ldquo;Advanced Options&rdquo;. At the top under &ldquo;Limits on curve generation&rdquo; are  the model specific limits and initial parameter values. Below that under  &ldquo;Conditions on prevalence&rdquo; are a set of higher and lower limits on prevalence  that can be set by the user in specific years. EPP supports up to five higher  conditions and five lower conditions. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image012_en.jpg" alt="" width="334" height="309" /></p>
<p>Users who wish to use advanced  options should consult <u>this help page</u> before making changes. Should you  make changes to advanced options, click Save in the lower right-hand corner  when done and these limits and conditions will apply during the fit for this sub-population.  It should be noted that these limits and conditions apply only to the sub-population  currently selected. If you wish to change them for another sub-population,  you'll need to first select it in the National Epidemic Structure panel, open  Advanced Options, make your changes and then save the changes <em>before</em> fitting that sub-population.</p>
<h3><strong><em>5. Click fit. What happens in the  EPP interface?</em></strong></h3>
<p>After completing the previous steps,  you are now ready to actually fit a model to your surveillance data. This is  done by clicking the large green Fit button next to the model selection. The  green Fit button will turn into a red Stop button as shown below, and EPP will  immediately start calculating. <br /></p>
<p align="center"> <img src="images/project_clip_image014_en.png" alt="" width="263" height="107" /></p>
<p>If you wish to stop the calculation  at any point, click the red Stop button, and EPP will abort the fit and it will  change back into a green Fit button.</p>
<p>Typically EPP will run for anywhere  from 5 to 30 minutes for a sub-population fit. During that time you will see a  series of messages in the status bar at the bottom of the screen similar to  those shown below. They will be counting up the number of curves generated, the  number of likelihoods (LHs) calculated, and the number of unique curves found  so far.</p>
<p><img src="images/project_clip_image016_en.jpg" alt="" width="771" height="25" /></p>
<p><img src="images/project_clip_image018_en.jpg" alt="" width="771" height="27" /></p>
<p><img src="images/project_clip_image020_en.jpg" alt="" width="770" height="26" /></p>
<p><img src="images/project_clip_image022_en.jpg" alt="" width="771" height="25" /></p>
<p>These messages will normally keep  updating while EPP is computing. These status lines are your primary indication  that EPP is continuing to work. When EPP is done, your final graph will appear  and the line at the bottom of the screen will now read something like this for Variable-r:</p>
<p><img src="images/project_clip_image024_en.jpg" alt="" width="771" height="25" /></p>
<p>And like this for EPP Classic:</p>
<p><img src="images/project_clip_image026_en.jpg" alt="" width="770" height="26" /></p>
<p>In addition to the graph now  displaying the best fit, bounds and selected curves, you will also notice is  that the color of the sub-population name has changed in the National Epidemic  Structure panel. If the sub-population has not been fit, it will be a light  purple in color. After it has been fit and the fit is saved, it will become dark  blue (see below). This lets you tell at a glance which of your sub-populations  have been fit and which have not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table align = "center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="319" valign="top"><p><img src="images/project_clip_image028a_en.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="270" border="0" /></p></td>
    <td width="319" valign="top"><p><img src="images/project_clip_image028b_en.jpg" alt="" width="287" height="261" border="0" /></p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If you are happy with the fit  displayed in the graph, click Save and continue and EPP will move you to the  next sub-population to be fit. When you complete the last sub-population fit  and click Save and continue, EPP will move you ahead to the <u>Calibration  page</u>. </p>
<h2><strong>What is the Fit All button? A time saver</strong></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, sometimes fits  can take a long time. If a fit is done using the Fit button, it will only fit  the currently selected sub-population. To fit the next one, you'll have to  click Save and continue and then click Fit again. This would require that you  remain engaged with EPP through the entire fitting process. If your country has  seven or eight sub-populations, that may keep you busy for quite a while.</p>
<p>The Fit All button has been added to  EPP to make your life easier. If you click the Fit All button, then EPP will  fit your entire set of sub-populations one after the other. When it is done, it  will return to display the fit for the first sub-population. After you click  Save and continue, it will show you the fit for the second sub-population. Clicking  Save and continue again will show the fit for the third sub-population, and so  on. Please note that you must click Save and continue for each sub-population  or your results will not be saved and you will need to refit that  sub-population.</p>
<p>The complete set of steps for using  Fit All is then:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click  on the first sub-population in the National Epidemic Structure panel.</li>
  <li>Select  the model to be used for that sub-population (Variable-r or EPP Classic).</li>
  <li>Select  whether you want 400 or 1900 unique curves for this sub-population.</li>
  <li>Click  on Advanced Options and set any limits and prevalence conditions for this sub-population,  then click Save on the Advanced Conditions page. </li>
  <li>Click  on the next sub-population in the National Epidemic Structure panel and repeat  the above steps for that sub-population.</li>
  <li>When  you have done this for each sub-population (i.e., set model, number of curves and  Advanced Options), click on Fit All.</li>
  <li>Take  a long break, EPP will fit all of your projections. When it finishes, it will  display the results of the first sub-population fit.</li>
  <li>Click  on Save and continue. EPP will show you the second sub-population fit.</li>
  <li>Continue  clicking on Save and continue until all the sub-populations have been saved.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: after using Fit All, please do  not move between sub-populations by clicking on them in the National Epidemic  Structure panel, instead use the Save and continue button, which will store the  results on the disk. Once you have saved all of them, only then can you move  among them by clicking on them in the National Epidemic Structure panel without  losing the fit.</p>
<h2><strong>Behind the scenes: what really happens when you click Fit?</strong></h2>
<p>This section is for advanced users  who want to understand how EPP actually fits your data and estimates the model uncertainty.  It provides a layman's overview of the Bayesian melding procedure used in EPP  and will help you to better understand both the messages you see in the status  bar while fitting and the advanced options available. For more detail refer to  the 2008 and 2010 supplements on estimation and projection tools in the journal  Sexually Transmitted Infections, available on the web at: <u>http://sti.bmj.com/content/86/Suppl_2.toc</u> and <u>http://sti.bmj.com/content/84/Suppl_1.toc.</u></p>
<h3><strong><em>The model parameters</em></strong></h3>
<p>Each of the models used in EPP, Variable-r  and EPP Classic (which is also used in Workbook fits), has a number of central  variables. For Variable-r, these are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An  initial small amount of HIV infection introduced in the start year the epidemic.  EPP sets the start year automatically based upon information on the early  history of the epidemic in your country.</li>
  <li>An  initial value for the force of infection, <em>r0</em>.  The force of infection, <em>r</em>, then grows  with a small randomly chosen initial growth rate until the first year of  observed data. As described in the <u>Overview</u> description of the Variable-r  model, <em>r</em> multiplied by the size of  the uninfected population and the prevalence gives the number of new infections  each year.</li>
  <li>A  value of <em>r</em> for each subsequent year until  the last year for which you provide data. The value of <em>r</em> is allowed to change by a small random amount each year.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the EPP Classic model, the four parameters  are the force of infection, <em>r</em>,  fraction initially entering the at-risk population, <em>f0</em>, start year, <em>t0</em>,  and behavior change parameter, <em>Φ</em>.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Fitting the data – randomly generate  a large number of curves from the model</em></strong></h3>
<p>While mathematically challenging,  the actual procedure for fitting the data is not too difficult to describe.  First, you generate a large number of possible prevalence curves by randomly  varying the different model parameters described above and calculating the HIV  prevalence from them. This is illustrated in the figure below which shows a  sample of 1000 initial curves for the Variable-r model. The gray lines are  different prevalence curves from randomly chosen values of the initial pulse of  infection, initial value of <em>r</em>,  initial growth rate and values of <em>r</em> in later years. For EPP Classic the procedure is the same except that you vary <em>r</em>, <em>f0</em>, <em>t0</em> and <em>Φ</em>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image030.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="199" border="0" /></p>
<p>As you can see, those curves in the  red box rise far too rapidly, missing the data entirely. Perhaps their initial  pulse of infection or initial <em>r0</em> was too high. Similarly, there are a large number of curves which never grow,  shown in the blue box. These probably had very small initial pulses or very small  initial <em>r0</em>. In the actual  EPP code, 10,000 curves are generated for Variable-r and 12,000 for EPP Classic.  While the curve generation is going on, the EPP status bar counts up as curves  are generated.</p>
<p><img src="images/project_clip_image016_en.jpg" alt="" width="771" height="25" border="0" /></p>
<h3><strong><em>Now compare the curves with the data  to see if they&rsquo;re close</em></strong></h3>
<p>Next we eliminate the curves that  are not close to the data. This is done by calculating a likelihood, abbreviated  LH in the status bar, which is a mathematical estimate of how close these curves  are to the actual data. Those curves with a high likelihood (i.e., close to the  data) are kept, while those which are really bad fits to the data (i.e., low  likelihood) are thrown away. While calculating likelihoods, the status bar will  update you on how many likelihoods (LHs) have been calculated so far. The  calculation of likelihoods is one of the most time intensive parts of the model  fitting and the time required to calculate each likelihood increases as you add  more sites. That&rsquo;s why countries with more surveillance sites on average take  longer to fit.</p>
<p><img src="images/project_clip_image018_en.jpg" alt="" width="771" height="27" border="0" /></p>
<p>EPP then throws away the curves that  were really bad fits to the data, resulting in the set of curves below,  selected from the entire initial sample of 10,000 curves. Notice that all of  these curves actually do at least get close to the data. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image033.png" alt="" width="369" height="192" border="0" /></p>
<h3><strong><em>Pick the best one and optimize it</em></strong></h3>
<p>Now from these remaining curves, EPP  selects the one that is the best fit to the data, shown below. This is clearly <em>not</em> a perfect fit to the data, but then  we have only tried 10,000 possible combinations of a large number of initial  parameters. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image035.png" alt="" width="379" height="198" border="0" /></p>
<p>Before proceeding to estimate  uncertainty EPP first improves this fit by applying a curve fitter. This step  is called optimization and it can take some time. While the optimization is in  progress you will see one of the two messages below in the status bar. That&rsquo;s  because two optimizers (Nelder-Mead and BFGS) are used to get a really good  starting fit.</p>
<p><img src="images/project_clip_image037_en.jpg" alt="" width="771" height="28" border="0" /></p>
<p><img src="images/project_clip_image020_en.jpg" alt="" width="770" height="26" border="0" /></p>
<p>When the optimization completes, as  the figure below shows, the curve is a much better fit to the surveillance data  provided. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image039.png" alt="" width="394" height="205" border="0" /></p>
<h3><strong><em>Now create some more curves around  the best fit found so far</em></strong></h3>
<p>Now EPP turns to generating enough  curves to let it estimate uncertainty. It does this by generating a new set of  curves that are randomly centered around the best fit curve so far. Some of  these are good, some of them miss the data – that&rsquo;s because they are still  randomly generated around the best fit curve.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image041.png" alt="" width="393" height="204" border="0" /></p>
<p>It now looks through the combined  set of curves, the original 10,000 plus these new curves, and it picks out the  one from the entire set with the best likelihood. It then continues this  process for up to 100 iterations. Each time picking the best curve, generating  a new set of curves around it, looking at the combined set, and taking a new  best curve. The following panel shows four steps in this process. Over time,  the process tends to select more and more curves that are closer to the data as  it successively picks better and better fits.</p>
<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="319" valign="top"><p><img src="images/project_clip_image043.png" alt="" width="308" height="161" border="0" /></p></td>
    <td width="319" valign="top"><p><img src="images/project_clip_image045.png" alt="" width="304" height="159" border="0" /></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="319" valign="top"><p><img src="images/project_clip_image047.png" alt="" width="308" height="161" border="0" /></p></td>
    <td width="319" valign="top"><p><img src="images/project_clip_image049.png" alt="" width="307" height="161" border="0" /></p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As EPP goes through this process, it  is keeping track of the number of curves that have likelihoods high enough that  they could be good fits to the data. This is done by estimating if that curve  would be selected in a random sample of 3000 curves from the entire set. The  3000 is the number entered next to &ldquo;# curves resampled&rdquo; and you don&rsquo;t need to  change this. The number that would be resampled is referred to as the number of <em>unique curves</em>, and it is printed in  the status bar along with the total number of likelihoods calculated so far  when each iteration completes.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image022_en.jpg" alt="" width="771" height="25" border="0" /></p>
<p>When the number of unique curves  reaches 400 or 1900, the number you chose under &ldquo;Purpose of run&rdquo;, EPP will stop  this process. At this point it goes through the entire set of curves generated,  picks out the unique curves and displays them on the graph, and then selects  which of them is the best curve. For each year, EPP then calculates the high  and low values that contain 95% of the prevalence for that year among all  curves and puts this on the graph as the bounds, shown as a dashed blue line.  The result is the figure displayed on the Project page.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image052.png" alt="" width="227" height="221" border="0" /> <br />
  <strong>One final step – calibration</strong></p>
<p>If you have a generalized epidemic  without surveys or if you have entered survey data and asked that it be used in  fits for either a generalized or concentrated epidemic, EPP concludes the  process of fitting the sub-population epidemic by applying a calibration.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Generalized epidemics no surveys</em></strong></h3>
<p>In many countries with generalized  epidemics the primary source of surveillance data is women attending antenatal  clinics or coming for PMTCT. Gouws et al (Sexually Transmitted Infection 2008:  84 (Suppl I): i17-i23) compared population-based surveys with antenatal clinic  surveillance in a large number of such countries, as seen in the graph below.  They found that in both urban and rural areas, antenatal surveillance data  overestimated general population prevalence by about 20%. For those countries  with generalized epidemics that do not have a large-scale survey to calibrate  against, EPP automatically applies downward adjustments on both urban and rural  components of the epidemic. This calibration is applied immediately after  completing the fitting and uncertainty procedure, before leaving the Project  page.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/project_clip_image054.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="299" border="0" /> <br />
  Source: Gouws,  Mishra and Fowler, SexTransmInfect 84 (Suppl1): i17-i23.</p>
<h3><strong><em>In concentrated epidemics you should  also calibrate, but it is not automatic</em></strong></h3>
<p>Similar results with large scale  population surveys have been observed in a handful of countries with concentrated  epidemics. To date the number of countries is limited, and the required level of  downward adjustment is not determined well enough to automatically include in  EPP. However, at present UNAIDS recommends that, in the absence of local data  to inform the calibration, countries with concentrated epidemics should adjust  antenatal clinic prevalence by a factor of 0.6 for women and 0.5 for men based  on what has been seen so far. This is done on the Calibration page, not on the  Project page.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Generalized or concentrated  epidemics with surveys</em></strong></h3>
<p>If the user entered survey data on  the Surveys page and specified it was to be used in fitting, this data is used  to adjust the final fit and the uncertainty bounds. The assumption is made that  the surveys, being done on a larger scale and generally with a better sampling  frame, are more representative of the actual national situation than the surveillance  data. Thus, the fits to the surveillance data should be adjusted to agree more  closely with the survey results. The calibration here is a two-step process:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Curves  are shifted downward to better match the surveys</em></strong>. The average prevalence difference between the curves which  have been selected and the survey data points is calculated. This is done for  each survey data year and then the average prevalence adjustment across all  surveys is calculated. All the selected curves are then downward adjusted by  this amount. In addition, a similar downward adjustment is applied to the  surveillance data itself when it is replotted. This makes the surveillance data  more directly comparable with the survey data, that is, it applies a country  specific adjustment similar to that discussed above for generalized epidemics  with no surveys.</li>
  <li><strong><em>A  combined likelihood is used to select the curves closer to the surveys</em></strong>. Because the large-scale surveys generally have a better  sampling frame and are more representative, their uncertainty better reflects  the overall national uncertainty in HIV prevalence than the full uncertainty in  the surveillance data. Therefore, after the downward adjustment is done, a  combined likelihood that measures how well a particular curve fits both the  surveillance data <em>and</em> the survey data  is calculated. This is then used to resample the curves and to select the best  fit curve. </li>
</ul>
<p>This procedure gives a best fit  curve that is generally also a good fit to the observed survey data. In  addition, it reduces the overall uncertainty in the country because there is  far less uncertainty in large-scale surveys such as DHS and AIS. The following  figure illustrates this, showing the difference in a fit done without the  surveys and a fit on the same data which includes surveys. Note how the  uncertainty bounds with the surveys included are much smaller than the  uncertainty without them.</p>
