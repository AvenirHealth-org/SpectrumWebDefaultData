<h1><strong>An Overview     of Using EPP 2011</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>What  is EPP?</strong></h2>
<p>The UNAIDS  Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) is a component of the AIDS Impact  Module (AIM) of Spectrum. Its primary purpose is to allow national programs to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define  their HIV epidemic in terms of a series of sub-epidemics in geographic areas  and/or sub-populations which are appropriate to their own local situation;</li>
  <li>enter  the HIV surveillance data and survey data gathered for each of those sub-epidemics;</li>
  <li>fit  a model to that surveillance and survey data, providing a curve that gives the  past history of each sub-epidemic in the country and projects the sub-epidemic&rsquo;s  short-term future; and,</li>
  <li>sum  all of these sub-epidemic curves to produce a national projection for past and  future prevalence and incidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>This  national projection, both incidence and prevalence, is then automatically  transferred to Spectrum. The tools in Spectrum can then be used to examine  program relevant outputs, e.g., annual new HIV infections, numbers of people  currently living with HIV, HIV-related deaths, number of children affected by  HIV, and ART need.</p>
<h2><strong>Changes  in EPP 2011 – an integrated Spectrum/EPP package</strong></h2>
<p>For the  2011 round of global estimates, UNAIDS has made a number of important changes  to EPP and Spectrum. These include: integration of the Spectrum and EPP  programs into a single package with a simpler user interface, improvements in  the models used for fitting national epidemics, and a new CD4 model for  calculating ART and AIDS mortality. These are intended to make the tools easier  for countries to use, allow for all projection related files to be stored in  one place, and provide program outputs that are more directly relevant to  national policy and priority setting.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Running  EPP from within Spectrum</em></strong></h3>
<p>In the  past, EPP was a standalone program. One would fit the epidemic using EPP and  then manually read the results into Spectrum to generate program relevant  outputs. However, this division of labor was sometimes confusing to countries  and also required them to enter some data more than once. The close integration  in Spectrum/EPP 2011 allows for a more holistic user experience, making the  entry of data and program inputs, fitting of the epidemic, and generation of  program relevant outputs more systematic and easier to follow. </p>
<p>The  overall process of applying Spectrum 2011 to prepare a national projection  consists of several key steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enter  program statistics and criteria for eligibility of treatment; </li>
  <li>create  a trend for incidence by fitting observed prevalence trends using EPP; </li>
  <li>specify  the sex ratio and age patterns for HIV incidence; and,</li>
  <li>generate  a national epidemic summary and programmatic outputs within Spectrum.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is  all done from the AIM module of Spectrum. These steps are carried out by moving  from left to right on the horizontal menu pictured below next to the small red  ribbon. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image002_en.png" alt="" width="678" height="117" /></p>
<p>To start  EPP, the user selects the &ldquo;Incidence&rdquo; item in the horizontal menu, as  highlighted in yellow above. This will produce a drop down list of options:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image004_en.png" alt="" width="111" height="94" /></p>
<p>The first  three options on the Spectrum Incidence menu, Configuration, Surveillance data  and Curve fitting, bring up the three key components of EPP. These will take  you through the process of fitting your national epidemic. As with previous  versions of EPP, each of the three components consists of two or more pages  that systematically step you through the fitting process.</p>
<h3><strong><em>EPP1  – establish your epidemic configuration</em></strong></h3>
<p>When you  click &ldquo;Configuration&rdquo; you will bring up the window shown below with two pages.  The Define Epi page, shown here, is used to define the geographic area and sub-populations  that together make up your national epidemic. The Define Pops page is then used  to set the population size for each one. In low-level and concentrated  epidemics, turnover, which refers to people entering and leaving the sub-population  is also set here if desired. When you are done, click &ldquo;Save and continue&rdquo; and  EPP1 will return you to Spectrum.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image006_en.png" alt="" width="500" height="285" /><br />
  </p>
<h3 align="left"><strong><em>EPP2  – enter your surveillance and survey data</em></strong></h3>
<p>Once you  have established your epidemic configuration, you next enter your surveillance  and survey data for each geographic area or sub-population by clicking  &ldquo;Surveillance data&rdquo; on the Spectrum Incidence menu. This brings up EPP2, shown  below, which has an HIV Data page and a Surveys page. The HIV Data page allows  entry of surveillance data, site by site, for the group highlighted in light  blue in the tree on the right; and the Surveys page allows entry of large-scale  survey data collected for the group. Click &ldquo;Save and continue&rdquo; to return to  Spectrum.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image008_en.png" alt="" width="500" height="310" /></p>
<h3><strong><em>EPP3  – fit your data to generate a national projection</em></strong></h3>
<p>The third  and final EPP step is to actually fit your data with a curve by clicking &ldquo;Curve  fitting&rdquo; on the Spectrum Incidence menu. This will bring up a window with EPP3,  shown below. EPP3 supports &ldquo;one button fitting&rdquo; on the Project page; allows you  to calibrate each of your sub-epidemic fits on the Calibration page; and allows  you to review incidence and prevalence in your overall national epidemic on the  Fitting Results page. When satisfied with the fits, click on the &ldquo;Save results&rdquo;  button and you will return to Spectrum. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image010_en.png" alt="" width="514" height="340" /></p>
<p>Once back  in Spectrum, you can review your sex ratio and age patterns under the Spectrum  Sex/Age pattern menu item and then generate your national results with the  Spectrum Results menu item.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Other  menu items on the Spectrum Incidence menu</em></strong></h3>
<p>You may  have noticed that there are three other menu items in the Spectrum Incidence  menu. These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Direct incidence input</em>. If you click on this, you'll be  allowed to enter your incidence trends manually rather than using the incidence  trends produced by EPP. You might wish to do this if you are using another  model, e.g., the Asian Epidemic Model, to generate incidence patterns. This  brings up the window shown below.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image012_en.png" alt="" width="448" height="222" /></p>
<p>You  enter your incidence year-by-year, providing a value for each year of the  projection. These values will then be used by Spectrum in place of the results from  EPP. If desired, you can also enter year-by-year prevalence values from another  model instead of incidence values by selecting Prevalence (15-49) above the  data entry row. If you have checked the box &ldquo;EPP prevalence adjustment&rdquo; then  Spectrum will adjust incidence as needed to reproduce the prevalence coming out  of EPP. By default this box is checked.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Restore values (EPP)</em>. If you have used direct incidence  input and decide that you would like to return to the values generated by EPP,  just click this menu item. Spectrum will return to using the results from EPP  instead of the values you entered manually.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><em>Review (EPP)</em>. In some cases, you wish to review  your national projection without running the risk of changing it. If you select  the Review menu item, you will see a submenu with the three EPP components  listed as seen below. If you select one of these components, you will have EPP  run in a special mode where it cannot change any of the files on the disk. This  ensures that you will not change the results in any way.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image014_en.png" alt="" width="203" height="119" /></p>
<h2><strong>Changes  in EPP 2011 – the models within EPP 2011</strong></h2>
<p>EPP 2011  includes three different models for use in different situations. The first  model, EPP Classic, is the four parameter Reference Group model used in  previous versions of EPP. The second model, known as Variable-r, allows  incidence to vary from year to year. The final model, known as the Workbook  model, is used for fitting results from the UNAIDS Workbook and is primarily  used in extremely low prevalence countries where time series for HIV prevalence  in key populations are not available. In EPP the first two models are applied  independently to each one of the sub-epidemics that make up the national  epidemic. These sub-epidemic fits are then summed to produce the overall  national prevalence and incidence. In the case of the Workbook model, applied  when available data is extremely limited, only one curve is calculated that  represents the entire national epidemic.</p>
<h3><strong><em>EPP  Classic</em></strong></h3>
<p>The EPP  Classic model was defined by the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modeling  and Projections in 2001. The model divides the population into three groups: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Those  with no risk for HIV.</li>
  <li>Those  with risk for HIV who are not yet infected.</li>
  <li>Those  who have contracted HIV.</li>
</ul>
<p>A set of  mathematical equations with four epidemiologically based parameters are used to  calculate the number of new infections in each year. The model then moves these  people from the at-risk but not infected group into the group of those living  with HIV. For a more complete description of the model see &quot;Improved  methods and assumptions for estimation of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and its impact:  Recommendations of the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modeling and  Projections&quot;, AIDS 2002 Jun 14: 16(9):W1-14.</p>
<p>The four  parameters used by the model are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>r</em> - rate of growth of the epidemic. When <em>r</em> increases the epidemic grows more  rapidly; if it decreases the epidemic grows more gradually.</li>
  <li><em>f0</em> - the fraction of new entrants into  the population who go into the at-risk category. This parameter largely  determines where the epidemic levels off. Larger values of <em>f0</em> lead to epidemics with higher stable HIV prevalence  levels.</li>
  <li><em>t0 </em>- the start time of the epidemic. This  is the point at which HIV is introduced to the population of the epidemic  starts to grow.</li>
  <li><em>Φ - </em>the recruitment or behavior change parameter. If <em>Φ</em> is positive then more people are  brought into the at-risk population (i.e. risk behavior increases) as people  die of HIV-related causes (increased recruitment), this helps to sustain the  epidemic at a higher level. If <em>Φ</em> is  negative then fewer people come into the at-risk population (people react to  AIDS deaths by reducing risk) and prevalence in the epidemic declines more  rapidly as those living with HIV die and fewer people become infected to  replace them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The parts  of the epidemic curve influenced by each of these parameters are shown in the  graph below. The <em>t0</em> parameter determines when the epidemic begins, but does not affect its shape.  The r parameter is most important during the rising phase of the epidemic,  while the <em>f0 </em>parameter  largely determines the prevalence to which the epidemic rises before it starts  decline. Finally the <em>Φ</em> parameter  determines what happens after the peak of the curve, with positive <em>Φ</em> producing a flatter curve and negative <em>Φ</em> driving the curve down more  rapidly.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image016_en.png" alt="" width="319" height="233" /></p>
<p>The  following set of graphs illustrates the effect of changing each one of the Reference  Group model parameters on the overall shape and behavior of the epidemic curve.</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="319" valign="top"><p><img src="images/overview_clip_image018_en.png" alt="" width="319" height="233" /></p></td>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>The  original Reference Group model assumed that the population was closed, that is,  people entered at age 15 and only left it by dying. In EPP 2011, however, the  population modeled is now 15 to 49 years of age. This correlates more closely  with the age range in samples of HIV prevalence collected from surveillance  systems. This means that people enter at age 15 and leave the population at age  50. We describe this by saying that there is age turnover.</p>
<p>In some  populations, there may also be turnover because people do not remain in a sub-population  with higher risk for their entire lives. For example, sex workers often enter  sex work at relatively young ages, work for 5 to 10 years, and then return back  to the general female population. This has implications for the relationship  between HIV prevalence and incidence in a sub-population at higher risk. In  general, the higher the turnover, the higher the incidence must be to sustain a  given prevalence level. Thus, if 50% of a sub-population at higher risk leaves  every year and is replaced by uninfected individuals, then to maintain the same  prevalence level, the incidence must be substantially higher. EPP 2011 allows  for turnover in any population by having user specify the average time that a  person spends in the group. This will be described in more detail on the Define  Pops page. A fuller description of the implementation of turnover in EPP can be  found in the appendix of the paper: &ldquo;Improving projections at the country  level: the UNAIDS Estimation and Projection Package 2005&rdquo;, Sex Transm Infect  2006: 82 (Suppl III): iii34-iii40. </p>
<h3><strong><em>The  Variable-r  model</em></strong></h3>
<p>As HIV  epidemics have run longer and longer, more complex patterns of prevalence and  incidence are starting to emerge. While the four parameter Reference Group  model worked well for the earlier stages of most epidemics, it cannot reproduce  some of the more complex patterns emerging such as that shown below. A number  of factors may be contributing to these changes including reductions in risk  behavior as epidemics become severe, increases in risk behavior as the severity  lessens, changes in behavior as ART availability decreases risk perception, and  prevention success, failure and fatigue. However, the EPP Classic model is a  fixed parameter model. Once the incidence declines, it can't go back up again.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image026.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="255" /></p>
<p>To be able  to fit the more complex trends emerging with long running epidemics, the  Reference Group recognized that it needed models that could allow HIV incidence  increases and decreases over time. Reference Group members explored new models  that could allow incidence to change from year to year. A decision was then  taken to use a model known as Variable-r. </p>
<p>In this  model the population is divided into only two groups: those who are not infected  with HIV and those who have contracted HIV. The number of new infections is  then calculated as a &ldquo;force of infection&rdquo; parameter, <em>r</em>, times the size of the uninfected population times the prevalence  in the population as a whole. But where the parameter <em>r</em> in the original Reference Group model was fixed, in the Variable-r  model it can assume a different value in every year, as shown in the figure  below. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image028.png" alt="" width="220" height="199" /></p>
<p>To fit  this model to the observed data, EPP uses these values of <em>r</em> to calculate the number of new infections in each year and then  applies HIV-related mortality to calculate the prevalence in each subsequent  year. A large number of such curves are generated and tested against the data,  and the one best fitting the data is selected as the final curve. The net  result is a projection which can reproduce epidemic patterns in which incidence  rises and falls as needed to fit the observed prevalence data. For example, the  prevalence pattern above was fit by the incidence pattern shown below, which  has two separate peaks.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image030.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="200" /></p>
<p>Those  wishing more detailed information on this model are referred to the paper &ldquo;A  stochastic infection rate model for estimating and projecting national HIV  prevalence rates&rdquo;, Sex Transm Infect 2010 86: (Suppl II):ii93-ii99.</p>
<h3><strong><em>The  Workbook model</em></strong></h3>
<p>The final  model available in EPP 2011 is known as the Workbook model. There are still  some countries with low-level and concentrated epidemics that do not have long  time series of HIV prevalence data for many of their at risk populations. Many  of these countries continue to use the UNAIDS Workbook. In the Workbook, the  user enters ranges in a particular year for HIV prevalence and population size  for the most important groups contributing to the epidemic. These are then used  to calculate the overall number of people living with HIV and the population  prevalence. If the workbook is applied to data from a number of different  years, it can produce an approximate trend in national HIV prevalence, as shown  in the figure below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image032_en.png" alt="" width="281" height="184" /></p>
<p>This very  limited set of data is far too limited to apply the Variable-r model, so instead  it is fit with the EPP Classic model. The net result is a single curve for the  national projection, shown here.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image034.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="216" /></p>
<p>EPP  estimates the uncertainty around this curve from information provided by the  user about the quality of the data. The exact methodology will be described  further in the help for the Project page.</p>
<h3><strong><em>The  CD4 model for HIV progression</em></strong></h3>
<p>The final  significant change in EPP 2011 is to introduce the new CD4 compartment model  developed by the Futures Institute in consultation with the UNAIDS Reference  Group. In this model, when people contract HIV, they are put into CD4  compartments. As shown below, there are 14 CD4 compartments in total, 7 for  those not on ART and 7 for those who have initiated ART. The fraction in each  compartment that move to a lower CD4 compartment each year and the mortality of  those in a given CD4 compartment is estimated from available cohort studies and  has been entered into Spectrum. Spectrum then provides this information to EPP  along with the number of people on ART, as entered by the user under the  Program Statistics menu item in Spectrum. When a person contracts HIV in the  model, they are put in either the CD4 &gt; 500 or the CD4 350-500 compartments.  EPP then calculates how many of them move between compartments each year and  how many die within each compartment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/overview_clip_image036.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="189" /></p>
<p>Summing  these compartments gives an estimate of the total number of people currently  living with HIV; and totaling up the mortalities in each compartment gives an  estimate of the total number of people dying of HIV-related causes.</p>
