<h1><strong>Survey  page: Entering data on large scale surveys</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Why  enter surveys? To get a more nationally representative picture</strong></h2>
<p>Since the beginning, the UNAIDS Reference Group has been  aware of the limitations of HIV surveillance systems. Originally established to  monitor the entry and initial growth of HIV in countries, the original WHO guidelines  called for them to be placed in high prevalence settings. With the rapid growth  of epidemics around the world, however, these systems were soon called upon to  provide much more than evidence of HIV entry. Lacking other sources of data,  countries and international agencies increasingly turned to them for an  assessment of the national HIV situation in countries. It was recognized from  the start that they were biased in an upward direction, being initially in  higher prevalence urban settings. As rural components were introduced, it was  further recognized that these too were most often upwardly biased - for reasons  of accessibility and ability to attain adequate numbers of specimens during the  surveillance period, they were often peri-urban rather than truly rural sites. </p>
<p>In most countries with generalized epidemics, the primary  source of surveillance data has been pregnant women, and initially it was  unclear how this related to overall national prevalence. In very few countries  was any prevalence data available for men. While studies generally showed  prevalence in pregnant women was a reasonable proxy for adult prevalence  levels, this was still an assumption in all early attempts at estimation and  projection. </p>
<p>In recent years, increasing numbers of national surveys,  e.g., the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) or AIDS Indicator Surveys (AIS),  have been gathering HIV prevalence data in large general populations samples of  both men and women. Some countries now have two or three DHS surveys with HIV  testing. Despite their own set of biases and difficulties, these surveys offer  us a new, more comprehensive, window on the actual prevalence levels in a  country. As the number of large surveys in a given country increases, they are  now beginning to provide information on prevalence trends as well.</p>
<p>Such surveys are extremely valuable in generalized epidemic  settings for calibrating the national epidemic. On the other hand, in most  concentrated epidemic settings, the prevalence levels are too low to measure  accurately using large scale population surveys without having excessively  large sample sizes. However, this does not reduce the utility of the Surveys  Page in concentrated epidemics. Many of the surveillance data sets gathered for  populations with higher risk have major biases of their own. For example,  surveillance data for people who inject drugs or sex workers is often gathered  in detention centers, STI clinics, or drug treatment centers. This data may not  be truly representative of the overall populations they are supposed to  represent because of biases associated with recruitment to each of these types  of sites. </p>
<p>Fortunately, today integrated HIV biological and behavioral  surveys (IBBS) or (IHBBS) are increasingly being done, which gather linked data  on risk behaviors and HIV. These often have more complete sample frames for people  who inject drugs or sex workers as a whole, and are frequently more likely to  be representative samples of the larger population of people who use drugs or  sex workers. They also often collect data on detention and/or treatment seeking  for STI and drug treatment. By linking the HIV data with data on those who have  been in detention or in treatment in the last year, calibration can then be  done for the trends in surveillance data to better reflect the overall  situation in these populations as a whole. </p>
<h2><strong>How  does EPP use surveys?</strong></h2>
<p>If you  enter survey data on this page, EPP will use them in two ways. First, they will  be turned into a separate data series which is combined with the data series  from surveillance sites to fit the overall trend in the epidemic. EPP will  assign sample sizes to each point in the survey data equal to the number of  people tested in the survey. This way, if there are two or more large scale  surveys, they will inform the actual trend that EPP selects for the epidemic.  In addition, during the initial fitting on the Project page, a calibration will  be performed so that the selected best fit curve is chosen from those that come  closest to the surveys, taking into account the standard errors in the surveys  themselves. This will result in a final best fit curve which better reflects  the national situation as shown by the large-scale surveys. It will also reduce  uncertainty in the national projection on the assumption that the errors in the  surveys are actual measurements of uncertainty in our knowledge of prevalence. With  proper care, the merging of the prevalence levels obtained from larger scale  surveys with the trends obtained from surveillance offers an opportunity to  more accurately assess the current prevalence in a country or sub-population  and the trends over time. </p>
<h2><strong>The  Surveys page – making estimates more representative</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="images/surveys_clip_image002_en.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="178" /></p>
<p>On first  entry, the Surveys page offers you two options for each sub-population as  highlighted in red above:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><em>Do       not include surveys in the fitting process</em>.       In this case, the surveys are not used in the fitting and no initial       calibration is done to the surveys, however, the prevalence levels found       may later be used to adjust the final HIV levels on the <a href="calibration.html">Calibration Page</a>. </li>
  <li><em>Include       surveys in the fitting process</em>. In doing the fitting, the       surveys will be treated as additional data points, albeit with larger       samples sizes than most. They are also used during the post-fit selection       of the best fit curve. Thus, they will influence the shape of the curves       chosen by the EPP fitters. </li>
</ul>
<p>The user selects one of these by clicking on the radio  button next to the appropriate option on the left-hand side of the page. </p>
<h2><strong>Data  to enter for each survey</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p>If you have a national survey or  surveys and choose the option of using surveys in fitting, a table will appear  for you to enter data as shown in the red box below. For each survey you have  in this sub-population, check a box in the table in the column labeled &ldquo;On&rdquo;. This  will unhide a line in the table where you can enter data for that survey.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/surveys_clip_image004_en.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="241" border="0" /></p>
<p>Now enter the following data into  each column in the table for up to 5 surveys:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong><em>Year</em></strong><em>: </em>the       year in which the survey was conducted </li>
  <li><strong><em>%HIV+</em></strong><em>: </em>HIV       prevalence measured in the survey for the specified sub-population. This is specified as a       percentage value between 0 and 100 percent. </li>
  <li><strong><em>Standard error</em></strong><em>: </em>the       standard error for the sub-population from the survey. Normally, this will be done       for urban and rural sub-populations with DHS surveys and the standard       error is available in the Appendices of the DHS reports. For IBBS and       IHBBS you will need to get the standard errors from the report. </li>
  <li><strong><em>Sample size</em></strong><em>: </em>the       sample size of the survey in the sub-population. That is, how many people were       tested for HIV in the survey sample. </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Choosing  not to use surveys after entering data – the data is still there</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p>Should you choose not to use  surveys, you need only click on &quot;Do not include any surveys in the fitting  process&quot; and the survey data entry table will be hidden. Should you wish  to enter survey data for possible later use but not use it for your current fit,  you can click on &quot;Include surveys&quot;, enter your data as described  above, then hit &quot;Save and continue&quot;. Select the sub-population again  in the National Epidemic Structure and change your choice to &quot;Do not  include any surveys in the fitting process&quot;. EPP will hide the table and will  not use them in doing fits on the Project page. However, the values will still  be stored and you can use them on the Calibration page to adjust your final  projections to agree with the observed survey prevalence levels. If you decide  later that you want to refit using the survey data, just click on &ldquo;Include  surveys in the fitting process&rdquo; and the table will reappear. Now check the &ldquo;On&rdquo;  boxes for any surveys you want to include in your next fit. </p>
<h2><strong>Document  your choices and move on to fitting</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p>You should always document the  sources and authors of the surveys used. This can be done by hitting the &quot;Source&quot;  button. In the box which pops up you should enter your reasons for using that  particular survey, the source of the survey prevalence values, and any other  information that is needed for someone reviewing your projections later. Once  this is done, click &quot;Save and continue&quot; to save the survey values and  your choice regarding use of the surveys in fitting and you will be returned to  Spectrum. Now choose Curve fitting (EPP) in the Spectrum Incidence menu and you  will be brought into EPP3 on the Project page.</p>
