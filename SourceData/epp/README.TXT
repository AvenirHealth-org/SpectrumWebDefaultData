This directory contains the EPP Files for Dec 23, 2010

This is an implementation of the EPP 2009 model with the new Spectrum populations used, including migration, but it does not include the new ART model and should be tested without ART for right now. It is only for testing of Spectrum-EPP interface issues. A version with the updated ART model and turnover implemented will follow in the second week in January.

This version has implemented the ability to change populations over time in concentrated epidemics.

Copy the full contents of this directory into the EPP subdirectory of Spectrum to use. It has been tested against the version of the Spectrum installer provided by Bob at the October Glastonbury meeting.
